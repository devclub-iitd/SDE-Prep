# DSA Problem of the Day (10/06/2024)

## Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms

After covering all the major data structures, we will now be focusing on few specific problems solving techniques.

## Problems

0. [Rudolf and the Ugly String](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1941/C):- Greedy and DP. Can every greedy problem be solved using DP ?
1. [AB Flipping](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1896/B):- Greedy and DP
2. [Mortal Kombat Tower](https://codeforces.com/contest/1418/problem/C):- Dynamic Programming.
3. [Even Number Addict](https://codeforces.com/contest/1738/problem/C):- Dynamic Programming.
4. [YetnotherrokenKeoard](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1907/B):- Simple Implementation. Try solving by iterating from the front and from the back too.
5. [Digit Queries](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2431/):- Make sure to use long long in this problem. What happens when you use int. Also implement it in python. Why no such issue occurs there. What is the internal implementation of integers in python.

## Resources

1. [Introduction to Dynamic Programming](https://cp-algorithms.com/dynamic_programming/intro-to-dp.html)
2. [Greedy Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/):- Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithm. Which is greedy ? What about Dijkstra ?

**Note:** Solutions to [day12](../day12) are uploaded.
