## Introduction to Caching

Today, you should learn about **Caching**, which is a technique used in computing to store copies of data or computations in a temporary storage area, 
known as a cache, so that future requests for that data can be served more quickly. The primary goal of caching is to enhance the performance and efficiency
of systems by reducing access time and the need for repeated computations or data retrievals.  

Caching enhances performance by providing faster data access and reducing latency. 
It alleviates backend workload, lowering the demand on databases and servers, and promotes efficient resource utilization. 
This leads to cost savings by minimizing the need for expensive, high-performance infrastructure.
    
To begin, Here's an excellent article for the Theory: [IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/hosting/technical-matters/what-is-a-cache/).   
It is also recommended to read the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) upto 'Writing Policies' to get a good understanding .    

Note: Hardware Based Caching and Software Based Caching, though being spiritually the same, are entirely different in terms of application. So keep this 
in mind while exploring the topic...!!!    

As this is quite deep concept, we will soon be covering the details and implementation part of Caching. So... Stay tuned...
