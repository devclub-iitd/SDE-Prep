# Today's Dev topic: Polymorphism in OOP

Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables different classes to respond to the same method call in a manner specific to their types. There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time (or static) and runtime (or dynamic).

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism**: This is achieved through method overloading and operator overloading. It allows the same function name to have different implementations based on the parameters passed to it.

2. **Runtime Polymorphism**: This is implemented using inheritance and interfaces. It is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
