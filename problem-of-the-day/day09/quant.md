You have an opportunity to make one bid on an object, whose value to its owner is, as far as you know,
uniformly random integer between Oand100. What you do know is that you are so much better at operating the
widget than he is, that its value to you is 80% greater than its value to him. If you offer more than the widget
is worth to the owner, he will sell it. But you get only one shot. How much should you bid? For example,
if its actual value is 10, youbid&winat11, and sell it for 18,makingprofit.Buti fyoubidmorethan18, you make
lose! But since you don't know how much its actual price is, how do you bid in order to make some profit?



Hint: Consider the case he already won the bid at $x. What happens next?
