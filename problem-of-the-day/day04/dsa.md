# DSA Problem of the Day (30/05/2024)

## Stack and Queue

To begin, follow [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) to solve the following problems. They will help you understand and practice key concepts in sorting:

1. [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/):- Those who know what a lexer is, can you think of a writing a program, which only accepts valid parentheses as input ? Can a finite state diagram without a stack/memory describe it ? If no, then one with a stack/memory ?
2. [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/).
3. [Orderely Queue](https://leetcode.com/problems/orderly-queue/description/):- Compare this problem with [Number Reduction](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1765/N)
4. [Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/).
5. [Implement Stack using Queues](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/description/).
