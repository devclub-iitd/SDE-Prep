x & y are two random points selected uniformly between 0 & 1. Using them, create a point uniformly random in a circle of radius 1. 
(uniform means that the probability density is constant) (Category: probability)



Hint: Convert Cartesian coordinates to Polar coordinates. And the area of a circle grows with the square of its radius.
