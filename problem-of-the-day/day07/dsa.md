## DSA Problem of the Day (03/06/2024)

### Introduction to Trees

Today we study about tree traversal, and then solve few simple problems. We begin with resources.

## Resources

1. [DFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dfs-traversal-of-a-tree-using-recursion/)
2. [BFS](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/01_bfs.html):- Compare the space complexity of this with DFS. Is it really greater than that of DFS ? Should we count of amount of extra stack space recursion consumes during DFS ? Can you implement BFS without using a queue ? Read about [Morris Travel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/morris-traversal-for-preorder/). Is it space efficient as compared to using the queue ? What about the extra space by creating the pointers ? You can try implementing these on leetcode.
3. [Inorder Preorder Postorder](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/).

## Problems

1. [Tree Diameter](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1131)
2. [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/):- Which type of traversal will help here ? Why not the other.
3. [Chamber of Secrets](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/173/B):- A grid can also be thought of as a tree/graph.
4. [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/):- You can try similar variations on leetcode.
5. [Anji's Binary Tree](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1900/C):- Simple implementation problem.

**Tip:- Think Tree, Think recursion.**

**Note:** Solutions to [day06](../day06) are uploaded.
