### Introduction to RESTful API Design

Today, you should learn about RESTful APIs, which are a set of rules that allow programs to communicate with each other. RESTful APIs are widely used in web development! It's named after **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer (REST); an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

1. [AWS - What is RESTful API?](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/)
2. [Hussein Nasser - Stateful vs Stateless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFPzI_Qg3FU)
3. [Rest API Tutorial](https://www.restapitutorial.com/) - This tutorial will help you understand the basics of RESTful APIs, including how to design and consume them.

## Tips

1. First, learn about HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.
2. Understand the concept of *statelessness* in a REST API.
3. Absorb the general structure and rules governing a RESTful architecure, keeping *statelessness* in mind!
4. Then, practice building a simple RESTful API using a framework like Express.js or Flask, and a simple database (a local SQL server or Mongo Atlas Free Tier will work!)
