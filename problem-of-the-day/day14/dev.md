# Dev Problem of the Day
### Introduction to Deep Learning

Today, we will learn about Deep Learning, an important field that builds on Machine Learning principles to solve more complex problems. Deep Learning is essential if you aspire to take on roles like data scientist, ML engineer, or AI researcher. Having a Deep Learning project on your resume can significantly improve your profile. Still, it also means you must understand the underlying concepts thoroughly, as interviewers often ask questions deep into these areas.
