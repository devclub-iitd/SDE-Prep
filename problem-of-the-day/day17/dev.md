# Dev Problem of the Day: Understanding the OSI Model 
## Overview    
Today, we will be learning about the OSI model. This is a critical part of interviews with a "Network" section in their Exams.   
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven distinct layers. 
Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, 
the OSI model facilitates standardization and interoperability between different networking systems and protocols. 
Each layer in the OSI model serves a specific function, and together they provide a comprehensive approach to networking.


### The 7 Layers of OSI Model: 
- Physical: Transmits raw data bits over physical mediums.
- Data Link: Ensures error-free data transfer between adjacent nodes.
- Network: Routes data between devices across networks.
- Transport: Manages end-to-end data transfer and error recovery.
- Session: Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
- Presentation: Translates, encrypts, and compresses data.
- Application: Interfaces directly with end-user applications and services.

### Resources to Learn
- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) has got a perfect article for an overview.
- [SpiceWorks](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-osi-model/#:~:text=The%20OSI%20model%20is%20split,design%20and%20equipment%20manufacturing%20principles.) also works just fine...

### Practice Problems
There is a question paper available at [Acadmia](https://www.academia.edu/23026253/CCNA_OSI_Model_Questions), featuring OSI model questions filtered from CCNA exams. 
CCNA questions are significant because they come from standardized exams by CISCO, an influential player in the networking industry (and a top recruiter!!!).

This is to give a slight overview of OSI, we will be covering Networking Protocols related to OSI in detail next week. So, Stay tuned...
