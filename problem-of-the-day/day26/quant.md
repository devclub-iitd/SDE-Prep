A, B and C are to fight a three-cornered pistol duel.
All know that A's chance of hitting his Target is 0.3, C's is 0.5 and B never misses. 
They are to fire at their choice of target in succession in the order A,B,C cyclically (but a hit man loses further turns and is no longer shot at) until only one man is left unhit.
What should A's strategy be?
