# Dev Topic of the day
## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a key idea in OOP that involves bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that work on the data into a single unit called a class. It has two main benefits:

- **Data Protection**: Encapsulation helps protect an object's data by controlling access to it. This is done using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.
- **Information Hiding**: Encapsulation hides the complex details of how an object works from the outside. This means you can use an object without needing to know its internal workings.
