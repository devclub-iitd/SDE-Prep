A dealer at a casino holds a game that is played as
follows: The player first pays $d to the dealer, where d
is some positive integer less than 100. The dealer then
intends to flip a coin d times. If at any point two
consecutive heads are flipped, then the dealer stops
flipping the coin, and the player wins and is awarded
$100. Otherwise, the player loses (and is awarded
nothing). A player pays the dealer $29. The dealer
weights the coin before flipping it, changing the
probability of flipping heads such that the player's
expected net profit is non-positive. The player is not
aware of this re-weighing. Find the maximum
probability that the dealer should choose.
