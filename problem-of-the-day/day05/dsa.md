## DSA Problem of the Day (31/05/2024)

### Linked List

To begin, follow **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)** to solve the following problems. They will help you understand and practice key concepts in Linked List:

1. **[Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)**:- Try doing it in O(1) Space Complexity. What is the loop invariant ? Try implementing recursive as well as iterarive.
2. **[Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)**:- Loop Invariant.
3. **[Design Twitter](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-twitter/description/)**
4. **[LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)**
5. **[Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)**

Observe that writing a explicit loop invariant helps a lot in debugginig linked list problems, as they handle corner cases quite well.

### Follow Ups

* Operations on stack/queue in C++ are slower than operations on deque. Why ?
