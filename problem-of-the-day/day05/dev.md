# Dev Problem of the Day
### Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Today's dev topic is a continuation of OOPs!
Hopefully, you all covered the short tutorial from day #2, which covered the basics of OOPs. Today, we will be learning about abstract classes and interfaces.
To learn more, here is an article on [abstract classes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/abstract-classes-cpp?view=msvc-170), and for interfaces, you can refer to this [article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_interfaces.htm).
For practice on abstract classes, you can attempt the following questions:

2. [Abstract Classes Questions - Set 2](https://www.sanfoundry.com/cplusplus-programming-questions-answers-abstract-classes-2)    
We will learn more topics in OOPs in the upcoming days.
