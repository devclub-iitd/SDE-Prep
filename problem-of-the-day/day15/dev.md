# Dev Problem of the Day: NoSQL Databases

## Overview

NoSQL databases are the most modern way of handling large volumes of data, high user loads, and frequent changes in data structure. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases are schema-less, which means they offer more flexibility and scalability for data that can be dynamic. Let's dive into the world of NoSQL and explore its various types and popular databases.
Understanding NoSQL databases is crucial for modern application development, especially when dealing with large-scale data and high-performance requirements. By exploring different types of NoSQL databases and their use cases, you can choose the right tool for your specific needs.

### What to Learn

1. **Introduction to NoSQL Databases**
   - Discover what NoSQL databases are and how they differ from SQL databases. Learn why and when you should use NoSQL.

2. **Types of NoSQL Databases**
   - Explore the different types: Document Databases (think JSON on steroids), Key-Value Stores (simple, fast, and efficient), and Graph Databases (perfect for relationships and connections).

3. **Popular NoSQL Databases**
   - Get to know MongoDB (the go-to document database), Redis (the speed demon of key-value stores), and Neo4j (the master of graph databases).

### Common NoSQL Databases

| Database  | Type           | Description                                                                 | Resources                                                                 |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MongoDB   | Document       | Stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.                    | [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/), [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/) |
| Redis     | Key-Value      | In-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. | [Redis Documentation](https://redis.io/documentation), [Redis University](https://university.redis.com/) |
| Neo4j     | Graph          | Graph database that uses graph structures for semantic queries.             | [Neo4j Documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/), [Neo4j Graph Academy](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/) |

### Practice Problems

1. **Basic CRUD Operations**
   - Implement basic CRUD operations in MongoDB.
   - Practice using Redis for caching in any of your projects.

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Think of a data model for a social media application using a graph database like Neo4j!
   - Think of a data aggregation pipeline to be implemented for a large point-of-sales system in MongoDB.

Happy Learning!
