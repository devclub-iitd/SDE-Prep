In a circle are light bulbs numbered 1 through n, all initially on. At time t, you examine bulb number t, and if
its on, you change the state of bulb t + 1 (modulo n); i.e., you turn it off if its on, and on if its off. If bulb t is
off, you do nothing. Prove that if you continue around and around the ring in this manner, eventually all the
bulbs will again be on. (Category: discrete)
Hint: It doesn't matter what the rules are, only thing that matters is that all bulbs should not go off!
