# DSA Problem of the Day (04/06/2024)

## Continuing with Trees

Today, we will be continuing with trees and delving into some advanced questions on binary trees. We will also study Binary Search Trees today.
Below are some problems and resources to test and improve your understanding of trees.

## Resources

1. **[Introduction to Binary Search Trees(BST)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-search-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/?ref=lbp)**
2. **[Binary Search Tree(BST) Traversals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-search-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/?ref=lbp)**

## Problems

Please find the problem links below:

1. **[Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/)** - Try not to use any extra space. How would your solution change if the tree was a Binary Search Tree?
2. **[Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/description/)** - Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?
3. **[Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/)**
4. **[Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/)** - Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
5. **[kth smallest element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/submissions/1204380583/)**
