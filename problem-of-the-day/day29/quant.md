Let v1 and v2 be two vectors of length 10. The elements of v1 are IID Bernoulli (1/2) random variables. The 10 elements of v2 are IID Bernoulli (3/4) random variables. Find the probability that v1•v2 is odd, where • is the dot product of two vectors.

Definition- Bernoulli random variable
X=Bernoulli(p) means 
X=1 with probability p
X=0 with probability 1-p

IID: Independent and Identically distributed
