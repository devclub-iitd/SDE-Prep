A group of students are sitting in a circle with the teacher in the center. 
They all have an even number of candies (not necessarily equal). 
When the teacher blows a whistle, each student passes half his candies to the student on his left. 
Then the students who have an odd number of candies obtain an extra candy from the teacher. 
Would all the students ever have the same number of candies after a finite number of whistles?
