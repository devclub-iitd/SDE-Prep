13 Apples, 15 Bananas and 17 Cherries are put in the magic hat. 
When ever a collision of two different fruits occurs, they both get converted into the third type. For example, 1 Apple and 1 Banana can collideto form 2 cheeries. 
No other collision is holy. Can a sequence of such magical collisions lead all 45 fruits to give just one type?
